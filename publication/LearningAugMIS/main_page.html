	We study the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on general graphs within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms.
    The MIS problem is known to be NP-hard and is also NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of n^{1-\delta} for any \delta>0. 
    We show that we can break this barrier in the presence of an oracle obtained through predictions from a machine learning model that answers vertex membership queries for a fixed MIS with probability 1/2+\eps.
    In the first setting we consider, the oracle can be queried once per vertex to know if a vertex belongs to a fixed MIS, and the oracle returns the correct answer with probability 1/2 + \eps. 
    Under this setting, we show an algorithm that obtains an O~(\sqrt{\Delta}/\eps)-approximation in O(m) time where \Delta is the maximum degree
	of the graph.
    In the second setting, we allow multiple queries to the oracle for a vertex, each of which is correct with probability 1/2 + \varepsilon. For this setting, we show an O(1)-approximation 
	algorithm using O(n/\eps^2) total queries and O~(m) runtime.
